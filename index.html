                        multidisciplinary creative based in Alberta, Canada. A character designer, illustrator, 3D
                        artist, and game developer with a passion for learning and visual design.</h2> <br><span id="introTrigger"></span> <p>Since graduating from the Multimedia Production program at Lethbridge Polytechnic in 2022, I
                            have continued to expand my illustration, 3D modeling, web development and game development
                            skills. My tools of choice include Procreate, Clip Studio Paint, Affinity, Blender, Nomad
                            Sculpt, Godot, Unity and Unreal Engine. I am currently working at Lethbridge Polytechnic as
                            an instructional assistant, helping students to develop their own creative skills.</p>
                        <p>I want to be able to see parts of myself in my own work, and for others to see themselves in
                            it as well, which is why representation, accessibility and creative intention are at the
                            heart of everything I work in.
